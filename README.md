# About the project


The project is an application that allows complete inventory management, from adding a new book to updating and deleting already added products, and at the same time, viewing history. You can also manage the sales portion of the same books. Finally, it allows you to manage a reporting section where you can view: sales history, view sales reports for a single author, view total prices sold and quantities, and more.


# How to use

A main menu will be displayed which will be divided between the 3 main modules: inventory management, sales management and sales report management. Within each menu are the series of options previously mentioned.
